0.11.0 (Lizard) (unstable) - 30.08.2023:
  * allow return values from functions decorated with @trace in Python bindings
  * allow conditional build of TCP listener
  * enable forceful compilation using C compiler (using `0DFORCE_C_COMPILATION=ON` cmake flag)
  * allow disable multithreading support (using `-DENABLE_THREADS=OFF` cmake flag)
  * fix MacOS build
  * add on-client-connected callback to TCP listener
  * improve test suite
  * minor fixes and improvements in documentation

0.10.0 (Squirrel) (unstable) - 19.01.2020:
  * fix amalgamation process for non POSIX.utf-8 locale (#65)
  * restore Python binding tests
  * simplify and document timeline features
  * allow using dynamic strings as labels for tracepoints in C language (C++ already had that feature)
  * fix memory leak on uninitializing HawkTracer library
  * implement automatic memory management for listeners (so the listener object no longer needs to be manually destroyed)
  * simplify FileDump and TCP listener's API (introduce one function to create listener and register it to a timeline)
  * introduce new, polished tracepoint macros
  * add more benchmark tests
  * minor bugfixes and documentation improvements
  * deprecate:
    - ht_timeline_register_listener: ht_timeline_register_listener_full should be used instead
    - ht_timeline_unregister_all_listeners: HawkTracer no longer allows unregistering listeners. Instead, user should call _stop() methods on the listener object
